**** TODO CSS border management
     - why do I need both .bottom-border and the div:nths to show the bottom border?
*** Refactor
**** DONE Refactor data structure
     - React apparently does not like nested data, which makes accessing and changing state a bit of a nightmare given my current setup

*** Bug
**** TODO Solveboard does not work if player inserts its own values
     - solve board at the beginning and store separately
**** TODO Check for failure does not seem to consider the starting values
**** DONE Fix border delineation for 3x3 squares
     - Currently delineate the 3x3 boxes with two border-width rules in CSS (a right hand border for certain cells, and a bottom for others).
     - I created a "right-border" and a "bottom-border" class, but I cannot get both to be used. Whichever class is at the bottom of the css file will be used and the other ignored.
**** DONE Should not be able to change the initial cells
