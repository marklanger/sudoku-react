     - why do I need both .bottom-border and the div:nths to show the bottom border?

**** DONE Refactor data structure
     - React apparently does not like nested data, which makes accessing and changing state a bit of a nightmare given my current setup

*** Bug
**** DONE Fix border delineation for 3x3 squares
     - Currently delineate the 3x3 boxes with two border-width rules in CSS (a right hand border for certain cells, and a bottom for others).
     - I created a "right-border" and a "bottom-border" class, but I cannot get both to be used. Whichever class is at the bottom of the css file will be used and the other ignored.
